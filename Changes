1.26	-Experimental code to persist routing information in the event that an interface's
         gateway is located at an odd IP address (not the first) and is configured statically.

1.25    -Fixed bug that caused custom chains to be overwritten when load_balance restarted.

1.24    -Fixed bug that prevented load_balance.pl from executing properly after
	a virgin install.

1.23    -Fixed memory allocation bug that was causing random silent crashes in lsm.

1.22    -Workaround for apparent lsm bug: binding to the device only doesn't allow ping
        to bypass routing tables. Must set source address as well.

1.21    -Added a failover-only mode (add "mode=failover" to config file) for those
	who want to use the failover feature without interface balancing.

1.20	-Further changes to support pre-run scripts that bring up interfaces at
	the last minute (e.g. openvpn)
	-Added an example configuration for load balancing over two openvpn servers.

1.19    -Expose a new interface_info() method to end users.
        -Change behavior of pre-run-scripts to execute AFTER the routing tables
         and firewall rules are flushed. This allows the pre-run-script to add
         routing and firewall rules and not have them flushed immediately afterward.

1.18    -Prevent gateways from becoming permanently inaccessible when they temporarily
          lose their assigned IP addresses.
	-Fix lsm to allow to specify virtual devices (e.g. eth0:1)

1.17    -PREROUTING rules for incoming traffic on the WAN devices were incorrectly 
	 setting a source filter. This is now removed.

1.16    -If an interface is down, or unconfigured, at the time of
	initialization, then proceed without it.

1.15	-Documentation fixes to force_route()

1.14    -Handle virtual interfaces correctly.

1.13	-Save and restore any custom chains found in iptables to avoid overwriting
	rules produced by other firewall manipulation software.
	-Add --flush option to load_balance.pl to override this behavior.

1.12    -Add locking to load_balance.pl script to avoid conditions in
         which multiple instances of the script is running.

1.11    -Fix inter-LAN forwarding when more than 1 LAN is defined.
	-Add ability to control whether packets are forwarded freely
	 among LAN and ISP interfaces or are restricted to certain
	 groups of mutually forwarding interfaces using the
	 forward_group configuration file option.

1.10	-Adjust interface parsing rules to recognize bonded vlan interfaces.

1.09    -Fix the way that load balancing marks work so that user code can
	 again "force" certain connections to go over one ISP or another.

1.08
	-Stability fix: restart lsm every time load_balance.pl invoked. This
	 avoids correct state not being detected if load_balance.pl called
	 while an interface is down.
	-Stability fix: prevent routing tables from being rewritten when
	 long_down_to_up event occurs (already handled by down_to_up).

1.07    -Bug fix: packets weren't being balanced correctly.
	-Bug fix: lsm action directories were not being installed in correct place.

1.06	-You can now assign weights to each of the ISPs in order to prefer one over the ohter

1.06	-Remove dependencies on interface configuration files. Everything figured out using ip route and ip addr.
	-Assign weights to ISPs for traffic flow preferences.
	-Allow user to take actions based on lsm events.
	-Retry interfaces that are not running at time load_balance runs
	-Remove dependencies on interface configuration files. Everything figured out using ip route and ip addr.
	
1.05    -Delete user-defined chains for the "nat" and "mangle" tables.
	-Create Net::Netmask objects using the new2() constructor, which returns
	 undef in cases when the address or mask can't be parsed.

1.04    -Add two new convenience methods: add_route() and force_route().
	-Add explicit pre-run and post-run scripts.

1.03    -Documentation fixes.

1.02    -lsm now calls load_balance.pl directly as an eventscript, rather than indirectly.
	-Cleaned up documentation.
	-Add --kill and --status arguments to load_balance.pl

1.01	-Update lsm config file when network configuration changes.
	-Use log-level 4 for all iptables logging events.        

1.00	-Initial release
